  Returns a simple status message.

- **POST `/api/predict`**  
  Expects JSON input:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2023-10-27T14:00:00",
    "temperature_2m": 20,
    "precipitation": 0,
    "weather_code": 1,
    "cloudcover_low": 10,
    "cloudcover_mid": 20,
    "cloudcover_high": 30,
    "wind_speed_10m": 5
  }
  ```
  Returns:
  ```json
  {
    "predicted_solar_generation_mw": 1234.56
  }
  ```

## Running the App with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-forecast-app.git
   cd solar-forecast-app
   ```

2. **Build and start the services:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the app:**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend health: [http://localhost:5001/health](http://localhost:5001/health)

## Project Structure

⌘K to generate a command
idk lets sort that out latet this and the actinos thingy whats the nex step in our project

No problem! You can always revisit the notebook and GitHub Actions issues later. Here’s a summary of where you are and some strong next steps for your project:
Where You Are Now
Backend and frontend are dockerized and working together.
Code is version-controlled and pushed to GitHub.
You have a basic CI workflow (pending enabling Actions).
Your project demonstrates both SWE and data science skills.
High-Impact Next Steps
1. Polish and Document
Update your README:
Add clear Docker Compose instructions, API usage examples, and screenshots.
Add a project architecture diagram:
Show how data flows from frontend to backend to model.
2. Frontend Improvements
Add data visualizations:
Use charts to show predictions, feature importances, or time series.
Improve error handling:
Show user-friendly messages if the backend is down or returns an error.
3. Backend/API Enhancements
Add API documentation:
Use Swagger UI or similar for interactive API docs.
Add input validation:
Ensure the backend checks for required fields and types.
4. Testing
Expand automated tests:
Add more backend and frontend tests to increase reliability.
5. Deployment
Deploy your app to the cloud:
Use platforms like Heroku, AWS, GCP, or Azure.
(Docker makes this much easier!)
Add a live demo link to your README.
6. Advanced Data Science (Optional)
Add model explainability:
Use SHAP or LIME for feature importance and prediction explanations.
Automate model retraining:
Add a script or endpoint to retrain the model with new data.
What Do You Want to Focus On Next?
Polish/documentation for portfolio/showcase?
Frontend features or UI/UX?
Backend/API improvements?
Deployment to the cloud?
Something else?
Let me know your priority or goal (e.g., impressing employers, learning deployment, etc.), and I’ll guide you step-by-step through the next phase!
give me a banging read.md after doing deep reseatch on my project read through every fucking thing 

Here’s a “banging” README.md for your project, tailored to showcase both your software engineering and data science skills, and written to impress technical reviewers, recruiters, and collaborators. This README is based on a deep dive into your codebase and project structure.
